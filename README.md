# TimeSeriesForecasting-ML
#### Task:
Model our time series problem, forecasting daily Sales_Growth_YoY for 250 companies, with ML algorithms. 

Specifically, the problem will be narrow down to "given 'Sales_Growth_YoY' for prior quarters (in terms of days), we forecast the expected 'Sales_Growth_YoY' at the next day for 250 companies in data. 

And the performance have to be better than the consensus estimates.

- section 2 👨🏻‍🔧 : Feature Engineering 
- section 3 👩🏻‍🔬 : Model Building & Evaluating

🚀 Ok, so let's start (find detail in **Time Series Forecasting .ipynb** )
